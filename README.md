## Where Do I Start?

Three steps from zero to productive:

1. **Run Hermes:** [Official docs quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/) (install, CLI, first chat).
2. **Add skills:** [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills) (broad library) or [litprog-skill](https://github.com/tlehman/litprog-skill) (literate programming).
3. **Add a surface:** [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) (Hermes GUI) or [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) (fleet / dispatch dashboard).

Then use the full list. Every entry has a maturity tag:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/start-path.jpeg" alt="Start with a working Hermes conversation before adding ecosystem layers" width="800">
</p>

| Tag | What it means |
|-----|---------------|
| **production** | Stable, documented, actively maintained; safe to build on |
| **beta** | Works but still evolving; expect some rough edges |
| **experimental** | Proof of concept or early-stage; learn before depending on it |

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/maturity-notes.jpeg" alt="Editorial evidence behind production, beta, and experimental tags" width="800">
</p>

Tags are editorial snapshots based on documentation, setup evidence, maintenance, and
adoption signals. Re-check the linked project before depending on it.

## Check the trust boundary

An ecosystem listing is a discovery aid, not a security endorsement. Before enabling a
community skill, plugin, MCP server, or unattended job, verify who can trigger it, which
tools it receives, where commands execute, what credentials it can read, and how you can
stop it. Prefer the smallest toolset and an isolated backend for untrusted work.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/trust-boundary.jpeg" alt="Hermes capability and permission trust-boundary checklist" width="800">
</p>

Use the official [security guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/security/),
[tools reference](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tools/),
and [cron documentation](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron)
for the current controls.

For the operator routine around `/new`, `/resume`, `/compress`, `/branch`, export, and
pruning, use the [Hermes Agent session management guide](https://www.nyk.dev/blog/hermes-agent-session-management-guide?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=guide&utm_content=awesome-hermes-agent).

- **[beta]** [OMH (oh-my-hermes by rlaope)](https://github.com/rlaope/oh-my-hermes) by [rlaope](https://github.com/rlaope) - Wrapper orchestration layer installed next to Hermes — one `omh setup` installs 80+ generated workflow skills plus a deterministic chat router that turns free-form Korean/English chat into the right prepared workflow, clarifying instead of guessing when confidence is low. Coding work is delegated to an explicitly selected executor (Codex, Claude Code, or the Hermes runtime) with a strict prepared-vs-observed evidence boundary. A 156-case bilingual routing corpus and ~1,500 unit tests gate every change in CI. Pure Python, zero runtime dependencies, never patches Hermes; docs in four languages. Distinct project from [witt3rd's oh-my-hermes](https://github.com/witt3rd/oh-my-hermes) above. MIT.

- **[beta]** [shopify-app-review-brief](https://github.com/alfredtech2026/shopify-app-review-brief) by [alfredtech2026](https://github.com/alfredtech2026) - Privacy-first Shopify app review triage: source-checked worksheets an operator can audit rather than a black-box score.
- **[experimental]** [schedulala-agent](https://github.com/schedulala/schedulala-agent) by [schedulala](https://github.com/schedulala) - Schedules and publishes social posts to 12 platforms from an agent. Holds credentials for every platform it posts to, so scope its tokens deliberately.

### agentskills.io Ecosystem

## Memory Providers

> Persistent memory backends for Hermes Agent. Every install picks one — [official docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory-providers) cover the config. Managed via `hermes plugins`.

- **[production]** [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) by [Vectorize](https://github.com/vectorize-io) - Long-term memory layer for agents with retain/recall/reflect workflows. Integrates with Hermes via plugin or MCP and supports semantic, graph, and temporal retrieval.
- **[beta]** [LWC](https://github.com/JanYork/llm-wiki-cli) by [JanYork](https://github.com/JanYork) - Agent-driven proactive project-memory CLI. Maintains persistent, source-grounded knowledge across sessions using SQLite-backed Wiki with FTS5 retrieval, atomic changesets, optional document and code graphs, and bounded MCP exploration. Native Hermes integration via canonical `using-lwc` skill, unified read-only `lwc serve --mcp` endpoint, and `pre_llm_call` lifecycle hook. Apache-2.0.
- **[beta]** [Lians](https://github.com/Lians-ai/Lians) by [Lians-ai](https://github.com/Lians-ai) - Open-source memory for AI agents available through MCP. Runs locally with SQLite and no API key. Provides current and point-in-time recall, conflict history, memory lineage, feedback, reconstruction, and verifiable retrieval receipts. Bitemporal facts (what was known and when it was true), explicit correction history, and tamper-evident receipts. Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, C SDKs. Apache-2.0.
- **[beta]** [Open Index](https://github.com/DrDroidLab/open-index) by [DrDroidLab](https://github.com/DrDroidLab) - Structured context layer for domain-specialized agents with typed knowledge graphs, hybrid search, read/write MCP access, and a portable setup skill for Hermes. Unlike conversation-memory backends, models domain knowledge with typed schemas, entities, and relationships. Supports local SQLite and shared OpenSearch deployments. MIT.
- **[beta]** [plur-hermes](https://github.com/plur-ai/plur/tree/main/packages/hermes) by [plur-ai](https://github.com/plur-ai) - Native Hermes memory plugin for the PLUR engram store. Requires the `@plur-ai/cli` CLI (`npm i -g @plur-ai/cli`); then `pip install plur-hermes`, auto-discovered on gateway start with no extra config. Captures corrections and preferences as YAML engrams at `~/.plur/`. The store and all retrieval run on your machine — BM25 + local BGE-small embeddings, no external service for storage or search. Selected engrams are injected into the prompt you were already sending, so PLUR adds no network path of its own; optional `plur_sync` pushes your store to a git remote if you configure one. 22 tools including `plur_learn`, `plur_recall`, `plur_inject`, `plur_feedback`, `plur_forget`. Retrieval improves with feedback ratings; unused engrams decay via ACT-R. Zero Python runtime dependencies. Apache-2.0.

Embedded by default like SQLite (`pip install yantrikdb`, no server or GPU), with an optional HTTP backend for clusters. Self-maintaining: `conflicts()` surfaces contradictions instead of overwriting silently, and every `recall()` result carries a `why_retrieved` reason list. Requires `yantrikdb>=0.10.0`.
- **[beta]** [flowstate-qmd](https://github.com/amanning3390/flowstate-qmd) by [amanning3390](https://github.com/amanning3390) - Anticipatory memory for AI agents with RAG and vector search. Pre-fetches relevant context before queries hit the agent.

MIT.
- **[beta]** [hexus](https://github.com/codenamekt/hexus) by [codenamekt](https://github.com/codenamekt) - Postgres memory plugin and standalone MCP server. Local BERT (MiniLM-L6-v2) embeddings keep the memory hot path free of LLM and remote HTTP calls, with pgvector search, multi-agent storage, per-minion themes, and an async write queue. BSD-3-Clause.
- **[beta]** [hermes-penfield](https://github.com/penfieldlabs/hermes-penfield) by [penfieldlabs](https://github.com/penfieldlabs) - Memory provider for the Penfield knowledge graph — 16 tools, OAuth 2.1 device flow, stdlib-only, and the full MemoryProvider ABC (prefetch, pre-compress, system prompt block). Plugin is MIT, but it fronts the paid Penfield cloud service (no free tier).
- **[experimental]** [Tree Ring Memory](https://github.com/TerminallyLazy/tree-ring-memory-skill) by [TerminallyLazy](https://github.com/TerminallyLazy) - Skill-level memory hygiene for local files: recall, capture, audit, consolidation, and intentional forgetting. Listed here as an approach rather than a drop-in Hermes memory provider.
- **[beta]** [causal-memory](https://github.com/JingxuanC/causal-memory/tree/main/hermes-plugin) by [JingxuanC](https://github.com/JingxuanC) - Memory provider with a causal core: flat facts plus typed decision→outcome edges (caused / enabled / prevented) on a per-profile local SQLite store. Wired hooks for system-prompt causal directory, budgeted prefetch recall, and non-blocking write-behind; the store lives outside the context window, so memory survives Hermes compaction. Rust core, Apache-2.0.

## Operational Playbooks

> Practical workflow patterns that repeatedly help Hermes teams in production.

- **Nightly self-evolution + guardrail evaluation** — Run [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) on a schedule, then run a second verification cron to score quality and block optimization-loop gaming.
- **Memory pressure handling with Honcho/Hindsight** — If you are repeating context or losing long-term recall, review [Honcho Memory docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/honcho), and evaluate [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) or self-hosted memory backends.
- **Tune session timeout/expiry early** — Use [configuration docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration/) to adjust session retention for slower-moving threads so context is kept when needed.
- **OpenClaw side-by-side migration** — Keep both systems running during migration using [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) and native Hermes migration paths, then cut over once cron and routing behavior match.
- **Curate USER.md and MEMORY.md intentionally** — Treat profile memory as high-signal infrastructure. Keep entries concise, durable, and preference-focused instead of dumping raw notes.

---

## Level-Up Blueprints

> Opinionated bundles for teams that want to get more out of Hermes quickly without assembling the stack from scratch.

- **Memory stack that actually compounds** — Start with built-in Hermes memory, then add [honcho-self-hosted](https://github.com/elkimek/honcho-self-hosted) when you want stronger cross-session user modeling, [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) when you need retain/recall/reflect workflows across large histories, and [plur](https://github.com/plur-ai/plur) when you want portable shared memory artifacts in an open engram format. If you also want proactive recall, pair it with [flowstate-qmd](https://github.com/amanning3390/flowstate-qmd).
- **Self-improvement without self-delusion** — Pair [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) with scheduled regression checks, [lintlang](https://github.com/roli-lpci/lintlang) for prompt/config linting, and a second evaluation pass that blocks bad prompt mutations. The trick is not “evolve faster”; it’s “evolve without quietly getting weird.”
- **Operator cockpit for real work** — Use [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) for the richest daily UI, [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) when you need multi-agent fleet visibility and cost tracking, and [hermes-webui](https://github.com/sanchomuzax/hermes-webui) if you want a lighter ops surface.
- **Multi-agent execution layer** — Combine Hermes core delegation with zouroboros-swarm-executors for local Claude Code/Hermes handoff, and [opencode-hermes-multiagent](https://github.com/1ilkhamov/opencode-hermes-multiagent) or [bigiron](https://github.com/supermodeltools/bigiron) when you need specialized agent roles.
- **Migration + deployment hardening** — If you are moving from OpenClaw, keep [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) in the toolkit even if you prefer the native migration path. For repeatable deploys, look at [nix-hermes-agent](https://github.com/0xrsydn/nix-hermes-agent), [hermes-agent-docker](https://github.com/xmbshwll/hermes-agent-docker), and [evey-setup](https://github.com/42-evey/evey-setup) depending on how opinionated you want the stack to be.
- **Paperclip-managed autonomous ops** — For teams that want Hermes operating inside a governed company workflow, combine [hermes-paperclip-adapter](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-paperclip-adapter) with Hermes cron jobs and one of the operator dashboards above. That gives you task governance, approvals, and actual operational continuity instead of a clever demo that forgets what it was doing.
